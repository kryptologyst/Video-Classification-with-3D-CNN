# Video Classification with 3D CNN - Examples

This directory contains example scripts and notebooks demonstrating various features of the video classification project.

## Examples

### 1. Basic Usage (`basic_example.py`)
Demonstrates basic model creation, training, and inference.

### 2. Model Comparison (`compare_models.py`)
Compares different 3D CNN architectures on mock data.

### 3. Custom Training (`custom_training.py`)
Shows how to customize training parameters and use different configurations.

### 4. Video Processing (`video_processing.py`)
Examples of video loading, preprocessing, and visualization.

### 5. Evaluation (`evaluation_example.py`)
Comprehensive evaluation examples with metrics and visualizations.

## Running Examples

```bash
# Run basic example
python examples/basic_example.py

# Compare models
python examples/compare_models.py

# Custom training
python examples/custom_training.py
```

## Jupyter Notebooks

- `demo.ipynb`: Interactive demo notebook
- `model_analysis.ipynb`: Model complexity and performance analysis
- `training_visualization.ipynb`: Training progress visualization

## Requirements

All examples require the main project dependencies. Install with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notes

- Examples use mock data by default for easy testing
- Modify paths and parameters as needed for your use case
- Some examples may require additional dependencies (notebooks require jupyter)
